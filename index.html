        <h2>Bear with...</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 8 March 2019</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img24"><p>Image: Under maintenance!</p></div>
        <p>Sorry it's been so long since I last posted.  The end of 2018, and the beginning of 2019, have proved to be very chaotic and busy!  But mostly great, so that's something!</p>
        <p>Th biggest change that has affected my blog is the swapping of domains between my blog and portfolio websites.  As the blog was the first site I created for myself, it was originally hosted on the first domain I bought, namely www.dawnmcreated.uk (where you've previously wasted many a coffee break rolling your eyes at me).</p>
        <p>However, it makes far better sense to host my portfolio on that domain, since DawnM Created is the name of my freelance business, and for the blog to live here, at www.dawnm.uk (where you are now rolling your eyes at me).</p>
        <p>It was a pretty scary thing swapping the domains around, as I did it all myself, with no assistance from tech support.  I hoped I knew what I was doing, but was very aware that I might end up causing untold chaos for myself.  Thankfully the swap went without a hitch, and my now self-built portfolio has been live for some weeks.</p>
        <p>One thing that did go "wrong" with the swap is that I lost the Wordpress framework that my blog was built on, as it is not offered with the hosting for dawnm.uk.  This means I have had to rebuild my blog from scratch, which I really did not budget any time for.</p>
        <p>So now you know why the blog looks significantly different, and much simpler than the previous site.  This will of course change, as I slowly add functionality and tweak the design.  But for now I just really wanted to get the blog back online, so that I could start writing again.</p>
        <p>So in this time of transition and growth, I ask you to "bear with" as I work on my blog this year.  And absolutely <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#100;&#97;&#119;&#110;&#109;&#46;&#117;&#107;">shout out</a> any ideas you might have for discussion topics, website features, or anything else really.  As this is now on a more "personally named" domain, I will be fleshing out the topics a little, rather than focussing predominantly on my studies.</p>
        <p>Chat soon!</p>

        <h2>Halloween Hackathon!</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 29 October 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img23a"><p>Image: Halloween Hackathon Result - 1st Place!</p></div>
        <p>October has been a great month for me! I started coding my Project 3 for Code Institute, and I also took part in my first ever Hackathon!  I cannot begin to express how much fun it was, and what a buzz I got from it.  The hackathon was organised by Code Institute, and we were split into teams of 4 for the challenge.  Each team was then given 3.5hrs to build a website around 2 key words, while remembering to work as a team and show our collaboration using Trello.</p>
        <p>Our team (and many others) ended up being only 2 people strong, as most of the students also have work and family commitments that their studies have to fit around.  Anthony Bonello and I were given "Devilish Ghost" as our key words, and that was literally the extent of the brief!  I must admit I hate having to work from something so vague, but we did it!</p>
        <p>We decided to follow the KISS principle, and build a website that would showcase ghost stories from the Hastings, UK area.  This meant that we did not have any complex functionality to build, but we would still be meeting the hackathon brief. The only reason for choosing Hastings as our focus area was that I have been on a ghost walk there and it made a lasting impression.</p>
        <div class="blogimg img23b"><p>Image: The Monstars Team Trello Board</p></div>
        <p>Anthony and I had been chatting prior to the start of the hackathon, and had already decided that I would be the "crayon" in the team (a term learned from a fellow student, to refer to the designer).  So while Anthony put the HTML and CSS frameworks in place, I found images and content for our site, and did any editing that was required.  Anthony found our cool "ticklish" ghost though!</p>
        <div class="blogimg img23c"><p>Image: Screenshot of our Cloud 9 workspace</p></div>
        <p>We used Cloud 9 for our collaborative workspace, and it worked pretty well.  It was great being able to chat to each other in the same window where we were coding. Switching to Slack every time we wanted to chat took time, and really broke focus I must admit using Trello also felt intrusive rather than helpful, but project management is vital when working in a team.  It is something we all need to get used to.  These details all feed into the reason why the hackathon was set up in the first place – to give us exposure to a more 'real-world' experience than just coding on our own for marks will give.</p>
        <p>Once the basic structure was in place, I added the stories in the form of bootstrap cards, and helped tweak the CSS for the cards and footer.  All these last minute tweaks took place in the final half hour and the adrenaline rush was crazy.  At the end each team got a chance to present and discuss their work. I was blown away by how imaginative some of the ideas were.  We had a party website, a band page, and even an blood supply site for vampires!</p>
        <p>The biggest take-away for me though, was the amount of fun we all had.  How great it was to have an immediate deadline to work towards, and how that fuelled my productivity. This is ABSOLUTELY the career I want, and knowing that so strongly is a really great feeling.  It encourages me and makes me feel really excited for my future.  Winning was very much just the icing on the cake.</p>
        <div class="blogimg img23d"><p>Image: Our Prize: A Raspberry Pi Zero</p></div>
        <p>Anthony and I each won a Raspberry Pi Zero:</p>
        <blockquote>a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.<br>
        from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">raspberrypi.org</a></blockquote>
        <p>I have no idea what I want to build with mine, and that is the way it must stay for now.  The danger of derailing my studies entirely while I play with this nifty little toy is just far too great, so it has been packed away until I have my diploma.  I will definitely be blogging about that when the time comes though.</p>
        <p>A big thank you to my teammate, Anthony Bonello, and to the staff at Code Institute for setting this up and mentoring us through it. And a sneaky thanks to my Elf for proof reading the content as I put it together. Definitely one of my best days ever.</p>

        <h2>Results are in for Project 2 – Data Dashboard!</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 25 October 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img22"><p>Image: Screenshot of my data dashboard with an award ribbon for 87%</p></div>
        <p>Sorry for the delay in posting this update – I had it all prepped, and then forgot to ask my proofreader to actually look at it.</p>
        <p>I finally got my results for the data dashboard project that I submitted to Code Institute in August.  With the change to how we're able to submit they've just been inundated, hence the long wait.</p>
        <p>I was really worried about this one, as I hit such a stumbling block with the data charts that it set my confidence back really badly.  Many coders battle with imposter syndrome, and this website definitely tested my resolve about making such a massive career change.</p>
        <p>I am very pleased to say that the result was higher than I had hoped, at 87%!  The general feedback was:</p>
        <blockquote>The project is functional and has a positive aesthetic purpose. It is easy to use and data is easy to read and interpret. Underlying technologies are well used and implemented and the project shows a good knowledge of recommended web design conventions.</blockquote>
        <p>The difficulties meant that I learned even more, and I am more certain than ever that this is the career for me.  Even the hard days are good days, in the long run. Every code snippet that works brings joy and excitement.</p>
        <p>Thanks to everyone who keeps supporting and encouraging me.  You are more valued than I can ever tell you.  Especially my wife, who deals with all the frustration, and is still a willing sounding board to all my ideas. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Results are in for Project 1 – Resume website!</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 29 August 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img21"><p>Image: Resume website screenshot with award banner</p></div>
        <p>I got a very exciting email this morning – the assessment results for my first website!  I was almost too nervous to open it, but thankfully I'm more nosy than nervous!</p>
        <p>We get marked out of 5 for the following 18 areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project Purpose</li>
          <li>UX Design</li>
          <li>Suitability for purpose</li>
          <li>Navigation</li>
          <li>Ease of use</li>
          <li>Information Architecture</li>
          <li>Responsiveness Design</li>
          <li>Image Presentation</li>
          <li>Colour scheme and typography</li>
          <li>Appropriate use of HTML</li>
          <li>Appropriate use of CSS</li>
          <li>Version Control</li>
          <li>Testing Implementation</li>
          <li>Testing Write-up</li>
          <li>Readme file</li>
          <li>Comments</li>
          <li>Deployment Implementation</li>
          <li>Deployment Write-up</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also get written feedback on the following 5 areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usability and Real-world Application</li>
          <li>Layout and Visual Impact</li>
          <li>Code Quality</li>
          <li>Software Development Practices</li>
          <li>Overall feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My overall feedback was:</p>
        <blockquote>"The project has both functional and aesthetic qualities. It is easy to use and the project's code is readable and has a good structure. Software development recommendations have been followed and the project uses current design trends to achieve its intended goals which show good knowledge of web design basics and current industry standards."</blockquote>
        <p>As this area of study for me is so far removed from anything I have done before, I decided I would be happy with a "safe pass" mark.  So I am absolutely thrilled with the constructive feedback I received, and especially with my overall mark of 9.5 out of 10!!</p>
        <p>A huge thank you to everyone who has been involved, from initial support for this area of study (JP), study loan &amp; general encouragement (Mum), every day support, proof reading, ideas brain-storming, and celebratory pancakes (my beautiful wife), mentorship and general study support (Yoni and Tiffany at Code Institute), as well as all the friends, family, and fellow students who make up my amazing network.</p>
        <p>&#10084; Thank you &#10084;</p>

        <h2>Dashboard is DONE!</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 23 August 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img20"><p>Image: Screenshot of 3 pie charts</p></div>
        <p>I can finally share the good news hinted at in my previous post!  My data dashboard, which I first told you about in March (I know – who remembers that far back, seriously?!) is finally done!</p>
        <p>The even better news is that the dashboard (Project 2 of 5) and my resume created at the beginning of the year (Project 1 of 5) have been submitted for marking!  I can't tell you how hard my heart was pounding when I submitted my first project.  It was my first creation, my own little website, and I had to let it go – to be judged harshly (but fairly) and there is nothing I can do now to change it, or justify it.  It's out of my hands…</p>
        <p>But this is a good thing.  I am really glad that we can now submit each project as it is completed, rather than having them lurking there til the end and submitting everything together.  It means that I will hopefully get some feedback from the examining body before I replicate any errors on future projects. It also means that I cannot be tempted to "just fix that thing" or "tweak this feature" when I really need to be concentrating on the next module in my course.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to have a look at my data dashboard, you can find the website here, and for those who would understand it, the code repository is here.  This one does need to be viewed using a desktop computer or laptop, as there is a lot that needs to fit on the screen at the same time.  If it doesn't, the whole effect of the chart interaction is lost.  As it's interactive, play with it – click everything!  And as always, I'd love to hear what you think.</p>

        <h2>Unrelated news … sshhhh …</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 8 August 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img19"><p>Image: My Guide logo from Guide Dogs for the Blind</p></div>
        <p>I have some REALLY exciting developments happening with my coding studies, but I am going to be disciplined and wait until the project is actually complete before I shout about it.  I cannot tell you how difficult this is, considering it's taken months to get to this point.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, I can tell you what I am hoping to do with my (non-existent) spare time.  I have recently volunteered to become a "sighted guide" with The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association!  This was inspired by the volunteering my Mum does in this role, and from personal interests.  When I lived in Eastbourne, I worked with adults who have special needs, and I absolutely loved it – it was my most fulfilling role to date.  I don't want to return to that line of work full-time, but felt that volunteering in this way would be a great opportunity to still get involved with that kind of thing, and help those in my local community.</p>
        <p>But there is a 'selfish' aspect to this.  Having a positive impact on someone else's day is hugely beneficial to me too.  It helps me keep my spirits up on the dark days of my PTSD / anxiety attacks.  Knowing that no matter what struggle I am facing, I am still able to help someone else, can be a real lifeline.</p>
        <p>I did my first day of training in Shrewsbury yesterday.  I got to use the trains, which I really enjoy, and don't get to do nearly often enough since I'm studying at home.  The town itself is so beautiful that it's well worth a visit in its own right.  The staff I met with were absolutely lovely – so passionate about the work they do, and knowledgable about their roles and a lot of other areas that the organisation is involved with.  I am really looking forward to the rest of the training, and then getting stuck in to the role of being a My Guide.</p>
        <p>If you have any time or pennies that could be put to better use, please pop along to the Guide Dogs website and see how you can get involved with this wonderful organisation.</p>

        <div class="blogimg img18"><p>Image: desk with 3 screens showing my work</p></div>
        <p>Just a quick shout this week to let you know that my portfolio website is up and running again.  I had some issues with the theme I was using, so I needed to redo it.  It still isn't a self-build, simply because I don't have time to dedicate to that at the moment.  The important thing is that it's there, for now.  The graphics have been redone, and all the postcards in the gallery are up to date.  Graphics postcards links through to my Fiverr gigs, and postcards of websites I have built actually link through to those websites now! I use GitHub Pages to host these little project sites.</p>

        <h2>The Marketing : Design : Development Puzzle</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 9 July 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img17"><p>Image: ven diagram showing the overlap of design and development, with me in the middle.</p></div>
        <p>Today I was asked a very good question, and my answer ended up being so long, I figured it might as well be a blog post.</p>
        <blockquote>When you start advertising website development, how will you advise clients on the content portion? I've gone through $$$ on websites because no website developers accounted for the marketing and the content. … it's the number one complaint from all my CEO collabs.</blockquote>
        <p>I think it's a question that all developers should ask themselves at least once. It's one we need to know the answer to, because we can't manage client expectations otherwise. And it's a discussion that should be had with every client, before any job is agreed upon.</p>
        <p>Here is my take on this rather controversial topic:</p>
        <p>The easiest way I have found for explaining this, is to put it in terms of building a new house.</p>
        <p>You need an architect, a builder, and an interior designer. The architect and interior designer work with the client to best design a home that meets the client's needs and interests. This plan is given to the builder, who creates the structure for the paint and furniture to go into. The interior designer won't help lay plumbing, and the builder won't help choose your sofa. Sometimes the interior designer and architect can be one person, and sometimes your architect will be a building foreman. But you'll almost never find someone who can lay bricks, and wants to help you choose curtains.</p>
        <p>Websites work the same way. You'll have a marketer, a graphic / web designer, and a web developer. The marketer and designer will work with the client to design content, logos, and colour themes that portray the client's message and products while also meeting their users / buyers expectations. The developer will take these layouts and content, and build the structure that it all sits on, and the magic that goes behind the scenes so that shopping carts, contact forms, videos etc actually do what they need to do. Sometimes you'll find designers who like marketing as well, or developers that like to be involved in the design (logos, colours, etc – not content) process. But you will almost never find a developer who does marketing.</p>
        <p>Marketing requires knowledge of product and advertising trends. It's very involved with knowing what everyone else is up to, and into. It's a very demanding and fast-paced role. Design needs to know a little of these trends, but is more concerned with aesthetic appeal, and requires creativity and patience. It may look easy when you watch a pro, but design is hard, meticulous work. Development is very structured and mathematical. It's all about working within the limitations of coding languages, as well as browser and hardware constraints, in order to make the beauty dreamed up by the designer come to life, and interact with the user.</p>
        <p>Whether it's a house or a website, all aspects need to work together in order to create an end result that is both functional and appealing. They need to collaborate with, and understand, each other. But understanding these other puzzle pieces, and their impact on your part of the puzzle, doesn't mean you can be all the pieces.</p>
        <p>Keeping up with the fast paced changes in any of these areas also takes a lot of energy. Marketing, design, and technology trends and developments are happening constantly!  It's not like brick making which has probably changed very little since the first bricks were created.  Finding someone who enjoys all three aspects, and has the energy to stay current with all three, is probably about as likely as spotting the fairy who lives in your garden.</p>
        <p>What designers &amp; developers get wrong is not explaining this adequately to clients.  We don't want them to expect us to know everything about their industry or product without any discussion or knowledge share.  So how can we expect them to understand us, if we're not going to share our knowledge and discuss what we can and cannot bring to the table – in terms the client understands?</p>
        <p>Question credit goes to Shana Del Grosso, of Credit Shrink.  Discussions like this are a welcomed learning opportunity, and hopefully make me better at what I do.</p>

        <h2>Mini Projects</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 4 July 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img16"><p>Image: screenshot of 3 my mini projects</p></div>
        <p>My Full Stack Development course through Code Institute is a huge amount of information to take in, and I worry that I will lose the earlier skills learned as I progress through the course.  To prevent this, I am spending a little time every day working through the challenges on a great website: FreeCodeCamp. It gives my brain a rest from the really new things I am learning, while still keeping me focussed on code, and keeping the full range of languages fresh in my mind.</p>
        <p>The part I really love is that it gives mini development projects to be completed.  These all link to a test functionality which demands that various user requirements are met.  This to me is the closest I have found to having to meet a client's specs – there's no changing the whole idea if the project isn't going the way I planned, there's no negotiating the specs.  My websites either pass the tests or they don't, and I think this is a great experience to enhance my learning.</p>
        <p>I'm also working through a really helpful work book from Sitepoint called "JavaScript Novice to Ninja".  This falls in between Code Institute and FreeCodeCamp on my learning journey, and is deepening my understanding of the JavaScript language. This is vital given how extensively JavaScript is used in web development. It's also of interest as I am hoping it will help me understand the charting functions in D3.js, DC.js, &amp; Crossfilter.js that I encountered earlier this year, and still need to get my head around fully.</p>

        <h2>What's 3 months between friends?</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 21 June 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img15"><p>Image: </p></div>
        <p>It's been just over 3 months since my last blog post, and I must admit – it actually feels like many more.  I'm going to take this as a good sign that I have missed my studies, and my blogging.  I'm also going to be completely honest about my absence, because I believe that openness is the only thing that will start breaking down barriers &amp; social stigmas.</p>
        <p>I hit a major slump after my really great start to the year.  I started getting anxiety attacks several times a day, no matter what activity I was busy with.  I lost focus with my studies, and even my leisure activities.  I was battling to get restful sleep, even on the nights that I wasn't plagued by multiple nightmares.  I was very irritable (sorry Elf).  In fact, just writing this blog post is causing anxiety to build in my chest.  The main cause is PTSD from an incident that happened almost 6 years ago, but which my brain only now felt able to face.  Thanks for blindsiding me with that, brain…</p>
        <p>So I took a step back and asked for the help I needed.  It's a slow process, unfortunately, but at least there is the free availability of help.  I met with my GP, and then the Mental Health Nurse on their staff.  I was advised to contact my local Mental Health services.  This process was surprisingly easy, and after an initial telephonic assessment, I was recommended for Talking Therapy.  I also let Student Support know why my studies had slowed so drastically, and they have been really understanding.</p>
        <p>My Talking Therapy hasn't started yet, because we also took time to go to South Africa and meet the newest addition to our family.  A gorgeous, healthy, cheerful little boy who has completely stolen all our hearts.  Elf also put her foot down and insisted I do no studying on our trip – I wasn't even allowed to read my tech magazines!  I admit I cheated a few times, but the break really did do me a lot of good.</p>
        <p>Since coming home, we have moved into our own place, which has helped limit distractions.  And I've slowly eased back into my studies.  I'm using FreeCodeCamp to keep all the basics fresh in my mind, and working through "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja" to get a better understanding of the language before I attempt Project 2 again.</p>
        <p>If you are having a similar experience – please talk to the people who love you. And talk to the people who can help – whether that be a GP, church leader, community leader, or anyone else that you trust.  If someone you love is experiencing this – be there for them.  Listen, and encourage them to seek proper help.  It might take a long time before they're able to take that step, but don't ever give up.  If you're in the UK I would also highly recommend a Mental Health First Aid course.  You will learn how to recognise someone who might need a friend, and how to be there for them.</p>
        <p>So far the biggest lesson I have learned through all this, is that people are a lot more understanding, and willing to help, than I ever expected.  For this I am incredibly grateful – thank you.</p>

        <h2>Dashboards &amp; APIs...</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 7 March 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img14"><p>Image: Google map with lines indicating all my house moves</p></div>
        <p>I have made it to the next milestone project in my Full Stack Development course!  In these last modules I have learned about:</p>
        <p>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) &#8212; it makes the pretty stuff on our websites even more amazing!</p>
        <p>SVGs, D3.js, DC.js, &amp; Crossfilter.js &#8212; these are all used to create visual representation of data, which had my little geek heart singing.</p>
        <p>APIs &#8212; these are external code resources on which other awesome developers have done all the hard work, and now they're sharing with the rest of us.</p>
        <p>My current project idea is to create a dashboard showing information about all the times I have moved home.  I figure 40 house moves in 36 years should give me more than enough info to create a few charts, and I'll be making use of the Google Maps API to plot those moves as well.</p>
        <p>One thing I have already learned is that I need to start relying on my GitHub version control. I tend to problem solve by creating a duplicate of the troublesome file of code, and then I play with that until it behaves. The problem with this approach is that I'm often checking the changes I make against the original file, and in doing that I start implementing fixes on both the original and the test file. So while I've figured out the solution, I'm often not seeing the correct result, because half the solution is in the original file and the other half is in the test file. Serious face-palm moments I tell you. Thankfully the students and teachers on the Code Institute Slack channels are always on hand to point out my silliness, and they do it with such kindness and understanding that I barely even blush.</p>
        <p>This picture is of my first map, with lines showing how I've travelled across my little section of the world. This project is A LOT more daunting than the last one, but also really exciting. Watch this space!</p>

        <div class="blogimg img13"><p>Image: my resume screenshot</p></div>
        <p>This is definitely my most exciting post to date!  I have just finished coding my first ever website from scratch!  It's the first of 5 that I need to build as part of my Full Stack Development course, so it's an awesome milestone to have reached.  The feedback from my mentor was constructively critical, as it should be, but also overwhelmingly positive!  I'm not ashamed to say there were a few tears shed.</p>
        <p>I'd love you to check it out and as always, I value any and all feedback.  Until it goes live on my own domain, you can find it here.</p>
        <p>Huge thanks to all who helped: Coral, Mum, Robert, Morgan, JP and all the other family, friends, and fellow students who showed support. I couldn't have done it without you guys!  &#10084;</p>

        <h2>Typography Project!</h2>

        <div class="blogimg img12"><p>Image: David Marshall Quote: Typeface development is the most artistic science and the most scientific art there is.</p></div>
        <p>So today I have REALLY exciting news! Really exciting to me, anyway... lol</p>
        <p>I love the written word - I've been a bookworm from the day I learned to read. So it's no surprise that fonts are also pretty up there on my "oh wow that's interesting" list. So I thought "what better way to start building a design portfolio?!" I'm setting myself the target of creating at least one typography piece every month, and (surprise surprise) I'll be using quotes from my absolute favourite author - Sir Terry Pratchett. Now what makes this UBER cool is that I actually have permission for this from the people who control the rights to his work - Dunmanifestin Limited.</p>
        <p>I contacted them and asked permission, and I actually got a response! I was given guidance about what I could and couldn't do, and on what "legalese" had to be included in the image to make it acceptable. So please pop along to my portfolio site and check out my first little piece of artwork. You will find it in the carousel (the sideways-scrolly-thing of pictures) near the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>The very bottom of the page has a link to my Fiverr account, so you can click that if you'd like me to do some work for you, or you can click the "Walk All Over Cancer" badge and show us some support for the 10,000 steps we will be doing every day in March, to help raise money for a great cause.</p>

        <div class="blogimg img11"><p>Image: banner from cancer walkathon website</p></div>
        <p>Not much coding news this week.  I have restarted my project website (a CV website) but I don't have anything to show you just yet. The CSS (the code that makes the website look pretty) is arguing with me at the moment, but I will prevail! lol</p>
        <p>What I do want to share is that it's nearly March again, and that means "Walk All Over Cancer" is looming on the horizon.  I did this last year, and it was great motivation for me to step away from my screen and go walk-about.  Exercise for just my own benefit is far too easy to deprioritise.  This year Elf will be joining me on this challenge of walking 10,000 steps (each) a day, to raise money for cancer research, so that's even more encouragement.</p>
        <p>If you would like to add your support and encouragement, please pop along to our Giving Page (all officially set up via Cancer Research UK) and show us some love. Thank you xx</p>

        <h2>CV Website!</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 18 January 2018</h5>
        <p>I've finally gotten around to purchasing a domain for my Portfolio website. For now, though, my studies must take priority, so I've cheated and used a template just so that there is something to look at. I'm hoping that building the CV website will fit one of the projects required for my diploma, in which case I can get started soon. Either way, you know I'll keep you posted. Go check it out so long, and as always, I'd love some feedback in the comments on here. [Edit: this site as been changed by the domain swap at the beginning of 2019. Links are no longer relevant and have been disabled.]</p>

        <h2>GNU Terry Pratchett</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 17 January 2018</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img9"><p>Image: screenshot of lamp on my chrome</p></div>
        <p>This should have been written 2 weeks ago! How time flies!!</p>
        <p>Anyone who knows me, knows that I am an enormous Terry Pratchett fan, especially of his Discworld series.  I am also lucky enough to have family members who indulge that addiction, and I got several Discworld Emporium gifts for Christmas.</p>
        <p>Between that, and my web development studies, I remembered the quote "A man is not dead while his name is still spoken." from Going Postal.  In the book:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>the clacks are a series of semaphore towers loosely based on the concept of the telegraph. Invented by an artificer named Robert Dearheart, the towers could send messages "at the speed of light" using standardized codes. Three of these codes are of particular import:</p>
          <p>G: send the message on</p>
          <p>N: do not log the message</p>
          <p>U: turn the message around at the end of the line and send it back again</p>
          <p>When Dearheart's son John died due to an accident while working on a clacks tower, Dearheart inserted John's name into the overhead of the clacks with a "GNU" in front of it as a way to memorialize his son forever (or for at least as long as the clacks are standing.) [taken from GNU Terry Pratchett]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This appeals to me, both as a fan of the great author, but also as someone who has lost a parent.  And when Terry Pratchett died, fans figured out how to insert his name into the "overhead" on web pages, so that his name would be spoken forever.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the New Year, I inserted the code from GNU website into this page.  Now anyone who has the Chrome "Clacks Overhead" extension will see the little lamp light up  when they visit my blog on the Chrome browser.</p>
        <p>When I understand the code more, I will also use it on the sites I create, along with a line of code to always speak the name of my step-father.  It's been 5 years, and he is loved and missed every day. &#10084;</p>

        <h2>Python Challenge</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 28 December 2017</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img8"><p>Image: replit RPSLS game</p></div>
        <p>Wow!  I can't believe it's been so long since my last post!  I do apologise.  The upside is that it means I have been very busy with studies and also a little more design work.  And of course spending time with family and friends over Christmas.</p>
        <p>Much of what I've been working on is still very much "a work in progress" but I can share a little "fun challenge" that Coral and I played with earlier this month.  I'm focussing on Python in my course at the moment, and one of the most popular challenges for beginners is a "rock, paper, scissors" game.  Now obviously many people immediately think of adding Sheldon's "lizard, Spock" to the mix (thank you to The Big Bang Theory).  Although we knew it would have been done before, we wanted to do the same, and managed to add in the extra rules without looking at any other examples.</p>
        <p>We first just coded all outcomes if the user won, with an else instruction as the default if the user lost, but that didn't work.  We then coded all possible outcomes against each user choice, and the game worked!  Just a silly bit of code, but we really enjoyed working together, and learned a lot.  It was also really satisfying to know we achieved it without looking for help elsewhere.</p>
        <p><em>Please note we are experiencing problems linking to the game at this time. If you want to play, please <a href="https://dawnm.co.uk/RockPaperScissorsLizzardSpock" target="_blank">follow this link</a> to the repl.it website and try it out there. Remember to click the green "play" button.</em></p>

        <div class="blogimg img7"><p>Image: screenshot of great mentor feedback</p></div>
        <p>I had some great feedback from my Code Institute mentor on my prototypes, so this week has been full steam ahead with actually coding the websites.</p>
        <p>It's certainly tricky, and I feel like I am completely clueless! But I guess that is why I am a student... I'll share the desktop prototype with you this week, but not the code yet. That needs to be way more polished first! So just a quick post this week to let you know I haven't forgotten my blog, and hopefully I'll have some more exciting news next time!</p>

        <h5>DawnM, 9 October 2017</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img6"><p>Image: Adobe Xd layout for Colours! website showing full colour design and interactions.</p></div>
        <p>Last week was a really productive week! I sent the first logo ideas off to one client (for his gym) and finalised some changes for Ahloki, which is a long term project with so many amazing ideas happening. I love working on projects with so much heart.</p>
        <p>This week I am back to the prototyping of my Stream 1 project, and this is where it gets a little fun for you! I want you all to play with my prototype as it currently stands, and let me know your thoughts, good and bad! It is key for designers and developers to get feedback on their work. Just because we think it works or makes sense, by no means guarantees that anyone else will think so. And we don't design for ourselves - we design for <strong>you</strong> - so <strong>you</strong> have to be happy with it. :) </p>
        <p>The website (currently only in mobile format) will be for a nail technician who goes to her customers, rather than the customers coming to a salon. This website allows them to see what she is about, see what colour gels are currently available, learn more about the product she uses, and contact her for bookings.</p>
        <p>At the moment all the prototype can show is what each page looks like (with a few different colour options on the menu) and how you navigate between them. Please have a go, and let me have your feedback - if you have an Adobe Creative Cloud account (free) you should be able to comment directly on each page of the prototype.</p>

        <div class="blogimg img5"><p>Image: Adobe Xd layout for Colours! website showing only screen interations.</p></div>
        <p>Hi! Not the most exciting post this week.  It's been very design-heavy, as I've been working on my project prototype, and a logo for a friend's gym.  Neither are anywhere close to finished, but I will share a screenshot of the prototype for you.</p>
        <p>I was also contacted yesterday by a previous client who I did some freelance logo work for.  She needs some changes made to her logo to reflect changes to her products. So the design work will be continuing for a while.  I love design work as well, so I'm having a lot of fun.  Also loving Adobe XD - what an incredible piece of software - finding all the little features it offers has provided lots of "oh cool!" moments for me.</p>
        <p>I think the biggest excitement is that my wife has decided she would like to do some more studying, as she would also like something to be excited about.  So I guess I must be doing something right, if I'm portraying this experience as a positive!  I'll let you all know what she decides to study - she's trying out a few things to see what really grabs her.</p>

        <h2>Oh the relief! Project 1 is underway...</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 9 September 2017</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img4"><p>Image: Adobe Xd layout for Colours! website showing design wireframing</p></div>
        <p>I'm busy with the first of 3 study streams, on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
        <p>Stream 1 is all Front End (the pretty stuff that you actually see on your screen when you visit a website). So naturally at the end of Stream 1 we all need to submit a project that showcases these Front End skills that we have learned. I have really dreaded this part of the learning journey. I am no good at coming up with ideas for 'fake' projects / websites that no one actually needs. I certainly don't want to just use the suggested idea from the course - a band website. Partly because this just has no appeal for me, so I know I won't put as much effort in as I would something that was close to my heart. Since my grade is dependant on the work I do, I need to give it my all. The other reason is that I don't want to just use the idea they give - I want to put more thought into it. I want to make it my own.</p>
        <p>The Code Institute is kind enough to showcase previous submissions though - partly to recognise great work, and partly to inspire those of us who are still on the journey. Thankfully I'm not the only one who didn't just light up at the 'band page' idea. Having run the details past my mentor to confirm that they meet the crucial requirements, I am doing a business site.</p>
        <p>To really do this properly, I need to plan the site before I start coding. I need to decide what pages there will be, and what kind of information and media (photos, videos etc) will be on each page. I need to figure out a pleasing and practical layout for each page, and I need to work out how the pages will flow from one to the next, so that people can navigate around the site.</p>
        <p>We're introduced to a great tool, called Balsamiq, on this course. My trial membership has expired though - moving half way across the world will really put a big pause in things. So I had to make another plan. I started with pen and paper, which is always recommended. I found this far more enjoyable than I expected. I'm a horrible perfectionist, and get caught up in making every line and angle exactly to scale, blah blah blah. Which is not at all what is important at this stage of the project. It really stalls the creative process. So yay me for not being an annoying perfectionist this week!</p>
        <p>I also found (in my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription) an amazing little program called Experience Design. OMG but did this get me excited?! Yes, I just OMG'd at you like a silly teenager - but that's exactly how I felt when I realised what XD can do. So now I have a wire frame mockup of the rough scribbles that I made in my notebook. At the moment its still only the mockup for how the site will look on a phone screen (I used an iPhone SE as the base layout) but its a start. And that alone is the most enormous relief.</p>
        <p>As much as I always understood, in theory, the importance of sketching, wire framing, and prototyping first, last week this came home to me in a very real way. I tested out the mockup on the computer, and it all worked fine. So then I used the nifty option they give you of actually testing it on your phone!! All my menu items were too small and close together - I couldn't touch them precisely enough with my fingertips to be able to navigate the site. So I went back to the drawing board and fixed it.</p>
        <p>From what I understand, XD can do a whole lot more than this. But as a developer I am just using the very first stages of the tool, as I need to write all the code and functionality myself. I have a few more chapters on the coursework to get through though (AngularJS coming up). So between now and the October submission date, I should have lots more to tell you as my skills, and my web pages, grow.</p>

        <p>So I finally decided to get back on track with my blog (and my studies).</p>
        <p>This is as a result of an amazing turn of events. My lovely wife (my Elf) is now doing the job I was doing, so rent can still be paid, and I can return to full time study! Thank you Elf &#10084;</p>
        <p>The bonus for the company is that she's actually better at bespoke reporting than I am, so we all win. Sometimes the universe is really blatant in its support of my plans &amp; I love those moments.</p>
        <p>What I probably shouldn't own up to is the fact that I took so long to get back to my blog that I completely forgot that I'm using wordpress.org and not wordpress.com (which makes a HUGE difference) and I forgot my password. So it took me an entire day just to find my way back here! (oh the shame... and the fits of laughter at my own expense)</p>
        <p>But hopefully things are looking a little more presentable (I figured out how to use my preferred font &#8212; Ubuntu &#8212; and chose a more minimal theme, which I like). Onwards and upwards...</p>

        <h2>The forgotten blog</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 20 June 2017</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img2"><p>Image: dusty work desk</p></div>
        <p>Well that went, well, don't you think?!</p>
        <p>I read the article from the amazing people teaching me my new career (The Code Institute) and thought it was a fantastic idea. I went off and started a WordPress blog, feeling all fired up... and then life happened! It always does, and it always manages to distract me. It's something I'm working on.</p>
        <p>In my defence, part of the distraction were the fires that devastated the area around our hometown of Knysna (nize-nuh) in South Africa, in early June. You can check out the hashtags #KnysnaFires and #KnysnaRises for more info. But we 'dashed' back there for a week to see for ourselves that our loved ones were fine, and then came home and tried to carry on as normal again. But I was well and truly off track by this point.</p>
        <p>So once work is back up to date, I hope to return to this too. Catch you soon...</p>

        <h2>Why a blog?</h2>
        <h5>DawnM, 9 March 2017</h5>
        <div class="blogimg img1"><p>Image: Computer showing wordpress page and lots of discarded papers.</p></div>
        <p>I am a Full Stack Development student. I'm working towards a massive career change, which involves learning a thousand new things. I am no fresh school-leaver either, so I have to 'adult' daily. Plus I'm blogging... why on earth would I do that to myself? Isn't there already enough on my plate, without having to remember to regularly write something meaningful or interesting as well?!</p>
        <p>Apparently there are big benefits to blogging, as a new coder. And I believe in grasping every opportunity that comes my way. So I'm going to blog.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I've also had many people tell me that one day I should consider writing my life story. It's not all that sensational, but it's had its ups &amp; downs, and a few twists as well. So it might be worth rolling your eyes at, while you sip cocktails on the beach, sometime in the future. And I think blogging might be good practice for that too.</p>
        <p>So here goes - I'm blogging...</p>

        <!-- <div class="aboutimg">Image</div> -->
        <p>It's been suggested that Web Development students should blog to get experience in writing content.</p>
        <p>What better topic than the chaos that is my transformation from Administrative Assistant to Developer &amp; Designer..?</p>
        <p>And who knows, you may get some guff about the rest of my life too.</p>
